# What is this?

This is just my various desktop settings and themes. I thought I'd put 
them up here in case they'd prove useful to someone to extend/modify,
learn from, etc.

_regolith-themes_   - Themes for the Regolith Desktop Environment built on i3.  
_vim-setup_         - My vim setup (somewhat outdated as I use SpaceVim now, but might be useful for you as a startingpoint)
